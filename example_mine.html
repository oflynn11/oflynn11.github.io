  <h1>A bit about the Internet</h1>

  <h1>URL</h1>
  <p>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. it contains several different parts, include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the protocol: e.g. http, https, ftp</li>
    <li>the host: <a href="http//www.facebook.com"> this is a link to facebook </a> <a href="http//www.bbc.co.uk"> , www.bbc.co.uk</a> 
    <li>the path: e.g./news/local,/john.smith.95</li>

<h1>DNS</h1>

<p> DNS stands for Domain Name System. You buy a domain name from a registrar (e.g.: <a href="http//www.123-reg.co.uk"> 123-reg, <a/> <a href="http//wwww.godaddy.com"> GoDaddy) </a> They arrange for your server's IP address to be added next to the domain name on a DNS server, so that people can find your site. This process can take a couple of days to spread out over the entire internet as DNS servers take time to update one another using a 'gossiping' mechanism. </p>

<h1> Server-Side vs. Client-side technologies</h1>

<h1>Client-side</h1>

<p> Client-side technologies run in your web browser (e.g. Firefox, Google Crome or Internet Explorer). The three main client-side technologies are: </p>

<ul>
  <ol>1. HTML</ol>
  <ol>2. CSS</ol>
  <ol>3. Javascript</ol>
</ul>

<h1>Server-side</h1>

<p>Server-side technologies run on the server. There are many more possibilities here.</p>
